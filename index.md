# Education
I'm an undergraduate student (expected to graduate in 2023) from Turing class, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Peking University.

For my academic performance:
- GPA: 3.81/4.00, top 5%.

# Research Experience
Currently, I'm conducting research at [Visual Computing And Learning (VCL) lab](http://vcl.pku.edu.cn/index.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Baoquan Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iHWtrEAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Libin Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=q7FiLBkAAAAJ). 

For my research interests, I am broadly interested at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics. In particular, my current research focus on neural scene representations, neural rendering, human performance modeling and capture, and 3D reconstruction. For some of my previous experience:
- [3D human pose estimation in crowded scenes](https://github.com/19reborn/AlphaMocap) (2021.06 - 2021.08)
- Generalizable neural radiance field for human actors with pose control(2021.09 - Present)
