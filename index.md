# Education
I'm an undergraduate student (expected to graduate in 2023) from Turing Class, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Peking University.

For my academic performance:
- GPA: 3.81/4.00, top 10%.

# Research Experience
Currently, I'm conducting research at [Visual Computing And Learning (VCL) lab](http://vcl.pku.edu.cn/index.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Baoquan Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iHWtrEAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Libin Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=q7FiLBkAAAAJ). 

For my research interests, I am interested in the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics. In particular, my current research focus on neural scene representations, neural rendering, human performance capture and 3D reconstruction. For some of my previous experience:
- [3D human pose estimation in crowded scenes](https://github.com/19reborn/AlphaMocap) (2021.06 - 2021.08)
- Edit-History Visï¼šAn Interactive Visual Exploration and Analysis on Wikipedia Edit History (**submitted to VIS'22**, 2021.10 - 2022.4)
- Generalizable neural radiance field for human actors with pose control(**submitted to NeurIPS'22**, 2021.09 - 2022.5)
